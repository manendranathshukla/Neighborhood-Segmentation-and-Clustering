    "In this task, I am going to use Foursquare API and explore neighborhoods in select cities within Toronto and use the Foursquare explore tool to get the most commonly found categories in each neighborhood and use this feature to form clusters of neighborhood. K-Means clustering algorithm will be used to conduct this analysis. I will also use Folium to create visualisation of these neighborhoods and their clusters."
